# API Reference

The Beluga Manager Domain API provides a unified RESTful interface over the integrated open-source platform components (Kafka, Flink, Iceberg, Trino, Airflow, Superset, and Kubernetes). It exposes platform-level domain abstractions—Services, Pipelines, Data Assets, Resources, Events, Decisions, and Policies—rather than raw OSS management interfaces.

See the [Korean API reference](api-reference-ko.md) for the Korean version.

## Live Runtime API Contract

To avoid documentation drift, this reference does not duplicate request/response schemas by hand. The authoritative, OpenAPI 3.1.0-compliant specification is generated directly from source code Zod schemas (`@hono/zod-openapi`) and served at runtime by the Domain API process:

- **Local base URL**: `http://localhost:8787` (default port, configurable via the `PORT` environment variable; see [`packages/domain-api/src/server.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/server.ts))
- **Interactive Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8787/api/v1/docs` (served via `@hono/swagger-ui`)
- **Machine-readable OpenAPI 3.1 JSON**: `http://localhost:8787/api/v1/openapi.json`

To start the API server locally:

```bash
npm run dev:api
```

Developers integrating with or extending the Domain API should inspect `http://localhost:8787/api/v1/docs` for exact payload structures, parameter requirements, field validation constraints, and interactive request testing.

## Core Resource Groups

The Domain API organizes endpoints into nine distinct resource groups under `/api/v1`. Route implementations reside in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/):

| Resource Group | Base Path | Description | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Health** | `/api/v1/health` | Process health and version check for the Domain API itself (does not proxy upstream health) | `GET /api/v1/health` |
| **Services** | `/api/v1/services` | Unified view of integrated OSS platform components, health statuses, and capability categories | `GET /api/v1/services`<br>`GET /api/v1/services/{id}` |
| **Pipelines** | `/api/v1/pipelines` | End-to-end data pipeline topologies and stage execution states correlated across streaming, compute, lakehouse, and query engines | `GET /api/v1/pipelines`<br>`GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}` |
| **Data Assets** | `/api/v1/data-assets` | Cataloged platform data assets (catalogs, schemas, tables, topics) with query context and storage metadata | `GET /api/v1/data-assets`<br>`GET /api/v1/data-assets/{id}`<br>`GET /api/v1/data-assets/{id}/query-context` |
| **Query History** | `/api/v1/query-history` | Adapter-visible query snapshot; no persistent history. `sql` is returned verbatim and may contain sensitive literals; no redaction and no per-caller authz (the app has no auth middleware), so do not wire a live adapter until a redaction/authz policy is decided. Default: 503 until a live adapter is configured. | `GET /api/v1/query-history?page=1&pageSize=20` |
| **Resources** | `/api/v1/resources` | Underlying Kubernetes infrastructure workloads and operational objects (Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets) | `GET /api/v1/resources`<br>`GET /api/v1/resources/{id}` |
| **Events** | `/api/v1/events` | Platform timeline events, state transitions, and operational alerts, sorted newest first | `GET /api/v1/events` |
| **Decisions** | `/api/v1/decisions` | Read-only System-1 automated operational decision projections | `GET /api/v1/decisions`<br>`GET /api/v1/decisions/{id}` |
| **Policies** | `/api/v1/policies` | Compiled Beluga platform access control policies, role definitions, and binding projections | `GET /api/v1/policies`<br>`GET /api/v1/policies/{id}` |

### Route Details

- **Health (`/api/v1/health`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/health.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/health.ts). Returns `{ status: "healthy", version: string }`. Used for container readiness/liveness probes.
- **Services (`/api/v1/services`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/services.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/services.ts). Supports filtering by `type` (e.g. `kafka`, `flink`, `trino`) and `status` (`healthy`, `degraded`, `stale`, `unknown`, `unavailable`). The registry selects adapters by registered `type` before calling them; `status` is filtered after fetching health. An unmatched valid type returns an empty list without adapter calls. Selected adapter failures retain HTTP 200 with `unknown` entries and warnings for those entries on the returned page; excluded adapters cannot contribute warnings.
- **Pipelines (`/api/v1/pipelines`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/pipelines.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/pipelines.ts). Supports filtering by aggregate `status`. Single pipeline lookups include connected upstream and downstream stages. Each pipeline also carries a read-only `correlationLinks` array (default `[]`) of typed cross-service links: `source`/`target` (`kind` + `id`), `relation` (`topic-feeds-job` = Kafka topic to Flink job, `job-writes-table` = Flink job to Iceberg table, `table-served-by-catalog` = Iceberg table to Trino catalog, `dag-triggers-job` = Airflow DAG to job), `confidence` (0-1), `method` (`declared-label` 0.95, `name-convention` 0.6, `ambiguous-name-convention` 0.3) and `evidence`. Links are produced deterministically by [`correlation/rules.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/correlation/rules.ts); a declaration pointing at a non-existent target yields no link, and pairs with no matching key yield none (unknown) rather than a guess. Every link whose `method` is not `declared-label` is inferred, not a fact; ambiguity is counted from both sides, and generic prefixes (`prod`, `raw`, ...) never form a key.
- **Data Assets (`/api/v1/data-assets`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/dataAssets.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/dataAssets.ts). Supports filtering by `status`, `kind` (`catalog`, `schema`, `table`, `topic`) and `parentId` (direct children of that asset: catalog -> schemas -> tables; an unknown `parentId` returns an empty list; omitting it keeps the flat all-assets list, and `kind=catalog` lists top-level catalogs). Assets carry structured, optional hierarchy fields `catalog`, `namespace` (ordered segments), `parentId` and `path` (ancestor names); `name` and `id` stay flat/opaque for compatibility. Detail lookups include column definitions (`isPartition` marks partition columns) and sample query context; `childCount` on catalog/schema details is always `null` until node-level authorization filtering exists (ADR-0004 D7/D9).
- **Resources (`/api/v1/resources`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/resources.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/resources.ts). Supports filtering by `namespace` and `kind` (`Namespace`, `Workload`, `Pod`, `Service`, `Endpoint`, `Job`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`). `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources may carry optional `capacity` and `storageClass`; both are omitted when unknown and are not inferred for other kinds. `logsUrl` stays an external link for any kind, including `Job`; the Manager stores no logs.
- **Events (`/api/v1/events`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/events.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/events.ts). Note: Events do not contain a health `status` field; they are filtered by `severity` (`info`, `warning`, `error`). Each event may carry an optional `source` (`kubernetes`, `service`, `job`) distinguishing a Kubernetes Event from a Service or Job failure; an absent `source` means the origin is unknown, and clients must not treat it as authoritative or guess it.
- **Decisions (`/api/v1/decisions`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/decisions.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/decisions.ts). Supports filtering by `decision` outcome.
- **Policies (`/api/v1/policies`)**: Defined in [`packages/domain-api/src/routes/policies.ts`](../packages/domain-api/src/routes/policies.ts). Supports filtering by `role`.

## Upstream Adapters: Flink (opt-in, read-only)

By default the Domain API serves stub fixtures and makes no upstream calls. Setting `BELUGA_FLINK_REST_URL` enables the Flink adapter ([`packages/domain-api/src/adapters/flink/`](../packages/domain-api/src/adapters/flink/), issues #16/#35/#41); invalid values fail at startup.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BELUGA_FLINK_REST_URL` | unset (adapter disabled) | Flink JobManager REST origin, e.g. `http://flink-cluster-rest.streaming:8081`. Must be `http`/`https`, no path, no embedded credentials. |
| `BELUGA_FLINK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `2000` | Per-request timeout, integer 1-30000. |
| `BELUGA_FLINK_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `5000` | How long a pipeline snapshot (and the `/overview` result) is reused, integer 0-60000; `0` disables reuse (concurrent calls are still coalesced). |
| `BELUGA_FLINK_SNAPSHOT_BUDGET_MS` | `5000` | Total time budget to build one snapshot, integer 1-60000. When exceeded, pending requests are aborted and the jobs read so far are returned with a `PARTIAL` warning (or `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` if even `/jobs/overview` did not arrive). |
| `BELUGA_FLINK_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Global cap on in-flight JobManager requests across all routes, integer 1-32. |
| `BELUGA_FLINK_JOB_NAME_PREFIX` | `beluga-` | Removed from a Flink job name before name-convention correlation (`beluga-cdc_orders` is compared as `cdc_orders`). |

Behavior when enabled:

- Only `GET /overview`, `GET /jobs/overview` and `GET /jobs/{jobid}` are called ([Flink 1.20 REST API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/ops/rest_api/)); no mutating request exists in the client.
- `svc-flink` in `GET /api/v1/services` is served by the adapter (version and key metrics from `/overview`; `endpoint` is not exposed). `GET /api/v1/pipelines` returns **live Flink pipelines only** (one Pipeline per Flink job, id `pl-flink-<jid>`); stub pipelines are not mixed in.
- Load on the JobManager: concurrent `GET /api/v1/pipelines` calls share one snapshot build (single flight) that is cached for `BELUGA_FLINK_CACHE_TTL_MS`; one build is 1 `/jobs/overview` plus at most 100 `/jobs/{jobid}` (more jobs are cut with a `TRUNCATED` warning), bounded by the snapshot budget and the global concurrency cap. `GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}` reuses a fresh snapshot, otherwise reads `/jobs/overview` once plus only that job's `/jobs/{jobid}`. A failed snapshot is also cached for the TTL, so recovery can take up to that long. The Domain API still has no authentication; these limits bound, but do not remove, the load an unauthenticated caller can cause.
- Pipeline id is `pl-flink-<Flink job id>` (32-hex `jid`). It does not depend on other jobs, but Flink assigns a new `jid` when a job is resubmitted, so the id changes then. `GET /api/v1/pipelines/{id}` returns `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (not 404) when the JobManager cannot be reached; ids not in this format return 404 without calling upstream.
- Cross-route references: stub events, resources and decisions point at stub pipeline ids (e.g. `pl-lakehouse-ingest`) that do not exist among live pipelines, so while the adapter is enabled their `relatedPipelineId` is returned as `null`. All other fields of those routes remain stub data, and clients following those links get no related pipeline.
- Failures never reach the route as errors: an unreachable or timed-out JobManager gives `unknown` service health and an empty pipeline list with an `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` warning; HTTP 5xx gives `degraded`; malformed or unexpected JSON gives `unknown`. If only some `/jobs/{jobid}` lookups fail, the jobs are still returned with a `PARTIAL` warning (their sink tables are missing); at most 100 jobs are read (`TRUNCATED` warning); response bodies above 2 MiB are rejected while streaming.
- Flink job state to domain status (unrecognised states map to `unknown`/`unknown`; `RUNNING` with a failed task is `degraded`; `failureReason` carries only the state name, never exception text):

| Flink state | Pipeline/stage status | Job `lastRun.result` |
|---|---|---|
| `RUNNING` | `healthy` | `running` |
| `FINISHED` | `healthy` | `succeeded` |
| `RESTARTING`, `FAILING` | `degraded` | `unknown` |
| `FAILED` | `unavailable` | `failed` |
| `CANCELED`, `SUSPENDED` | `unavailable` | `unknown` |
| `INITIALIZING`, `CREATED`, `RECONCILING`, `CANCELLING`, any other | `unknown` | `unknown` |

- Correlation: Flink REST exposes neither Kafka topics nor labels, so no `topic-feeds-job` link is produced. The sink table named by an `IcebergSink` vertex of the job graph is added as an `iceberg-table` entity and linked through the existing name-convention rule (`method` `name-convention`, confidence 0.6; the Flink job-graph vertex is appended to `evidence`). The Iceberg stage stays `unknown` because it is not verified against Lakekeeper/Trino. Each live Pipeline has `correlation.method` `inferred`.

## Common Conventions

### Pagination

All collection listing endpoints support standard query parameters:

- `page`: 1-based page number (integer, min 1, default `1`).
- `pageSize`: Number of items per page (integer, min 1, max 100, default `20`).

Every collection response wraps results in an envelope containing pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 42,
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20
  }
}
```

> **Important**: `meta.total` represents the total count of matching items across all pages after query filters are applied. Callers calculating total counts or displaying KPI aggregates (e.g. total tables in catalog) must read `meta.total`, not `data.length`, because `data` only contains items on the current page.

### Response Envelope and Partial-Failure Warnings

In accordance with [ADR-0002](adr/0002-backend-api-technology.md) partial-failure semantics, the failure or degradation of an individual upstream service does not fail the entire API request. Instead, available data is returned and degradation is communicated via the `warnings` array:

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 5,
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20
  },
  "warnings": [
    {
      "code": "DEGRADED",
      "message": "Service 'Kafka' status is degraded",
      "serviceId": "svc-kafka"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `warnings` array is omitted from the response envelope when all components are healthy.

### Uniform Error Structure

All endpoints share a consistent error envelope for validation errors (400), missing resources (404), and server errors (500):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Query parameter 'page' must be greater than or equal to 1"
  }
}
```

Recognized error codes are:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (HTTP 400): Request parameters or body failed schema validation.
- `NOT_FOUND` (HTTP 404): Requested resource identifier does not exist or route is not matched.
- `INTERNAL_ERROR` (HTTP 500): Internal server error; detailed exception traces are logged on the server and omitted from the response body to prevent leakage.
- `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (HTTP 503): A required upstream service (e.g. Trino for `query-context`) is unavailable, timed out, or has no endpoint. Distinct from `NOT_FOUND`; clients may retry.

### Locale-Neutral Payloads

All Domain API resources, entity names, status tokens, and error payloads are strictly locale-neutral. Localization into Korean (`ko-KR`) or English (`en-US`), along with localized number and date formatting, is handled exclusively by the web frontend. See the Internationalization section in the [Development Guide](development.md#internationalization).
